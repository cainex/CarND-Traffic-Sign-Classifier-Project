###Data Set Summary & Exploration

####1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

Size and shape of training, validation and testing sets was determined by the NumPY shape of the variables filled in by reading in the pickled dataset.

The number of classes was determined by reading in the provided CSV file using the CSV reader.

* Number of training examples = 34799
* Number of validation examples =  4410
* Number of testing examples = 12630
* Image data shape = (32, 32, 3)
* Number of classes = 43

####2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Below is a visualization of the provided data sets. The histograms show the distribution of each class within the three datasets. We can see that the distribution of images is not uniform across all classes, with many classes being under-represented. A sampling of images is show (along with the corresponding grayscaled version of the image).

###Design and Test a Model Architecture

####1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

The pre-processing steps for the input images is a simple 3-stage pipeline:

1) Convert image to grayscale using OpenCV.cvtColor() [Returned image is shape (32x32)]
2) Normalize image by subtracting 128 and dividing by 128 for each pixel value.
3) Reshape output image to be shape 32x32x1

For the training set, the dataset has been augmented. For each image in the training set, 3 additional images are generated from the grayscaled image in step 1 of the pre-processing pipeline. The three additional images are generated by taking a random rotation in the range of -30 degrees to -5 degrees and 30 degrees and 5 degrees. The -5 degress to 5 degrees sub-range is removed to reduce the probability that the resulting image is too close to the original image. Along with the rotation, the image is also randomly scaled in the range 75% to 100%.

The rotation was achieved using the OpenCV WarpAffine function along with the getRotationMatrix2D function to create the translation matrix from rotation angle and scale factor. The WarpAffine is done using the BORDER_REPLICATE border mode to remove the black bars at the edges of the scaled and rotated image. I felt these black bars may cause the network to incorrectly train on those edges.

The resulting dataset has 4 images for each image provided in the pickled dataset (grayscale+3 rotated/scaled grayscale images). An example of three images is show below, with the original provided image, and the 4 images that are used as the training set.

####2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

The final model I created, TrafficSignNet, was inspired by [GoogLeNet](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~wliu/papers/GoogLeNet.pdf). The main distinguishing feature of GoogLeNet is the use of [inception layers](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-Inception-module-work-in-GoogLeNet-deep-architecture), which I have used in my model. An inception layer consists of 4 parallel layers which operate on the input to the layer, and are concatenated in the depth dimension at the output of the layer:

![alt text][inception_layer]

The inception layer allows the model to not have to choose the best patch size at that particular stage, instead allowing the network to train several possible patch sizes and operations and get the benefit from all of them. The 1x1 convolutions set before the 3x3 and 5x5 convolution branches are used to reduce the dimensionality that is input into the 3x3 and 5x5 convolutions greatly reducing the compute needed for those layers.

One additional interesting characteristic of GoogLeNet, which was also used in TrafficSignNet, is the use of an average pooling layer to "flatten" the final output, rather than reshaping the output from the final convolution stage with a series of fully-connected layers to step down the output shape to the desired number of logits. Only a single fully-connected layer is used for a final reduction to the desired 43 logits. For example, the final convolution layer is 5x5x64 (1600), to reduce this to the desired 43 logits would likely have required several fully connected layers to effectively reduce down. However, an average pooling layer with size (5x5), stride 1 and valid padding returns an output of 1x1x64 (64), which can be reduced to 43 effectively in 1 small fully-connected layer with very good results.

Additionally dropout was added in the average pooling layer.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Type                  | Patch Size/Stride	| Padding | Output Size |
|:---------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------:|:-----------:| 
| Convolution           | 5x5/1             | SAME    | 32x32x32    |
| Convolution           | 5x5/1             | VALID   | 28x28x32    |
| Max Pool              | 2x2/2             | VALID   | 14x14x32    |
| Convolution           | 5x5/1             | SAME    | 14x14x64    |
| Convolution           | 5x5/1             | VALID   | 10x10x64    |
| Inception             |                   |         | 10x10x32    |
| Inception             |                   |         | 10x10x64    |
| Max Pool              | 2x2/2             | VALID   | 5x5x64      |
| Avg Pool (w/ dropout) | 5x5/1             | VALID   | 1x1x64      |
| Fully Connected       |                   |         | 43          |


####3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an ....

####4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of ?
* validation set accuracy of ? 
* test set accuracy of ?

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
* What were some problems with the initial architecture?
* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.
* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
 

###Test a Model on New Images

####1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image4] ![alt text][image5] ![alt text][image6] 
![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8]

The first image might be difficult to classify because ...

####2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Stop Sign      		| Stop sign   									| 
| U-turn     			| U-turn 										|
| Yield					| Yield											|
| 100 km/h	      		| Bumpy Road					 				|
| Slippery Road			| Slippery Road      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 80%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of ...

####3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|


For the second image ... 

### (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)
####1. Discuss the visual output of your trained network's feature maps. What characteristics did the neural network use to make classifications?
