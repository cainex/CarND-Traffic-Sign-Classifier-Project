### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

Size and shape of training, validation and testing sets was determined by the NumPY shape of the variables filled in by reading in the pickled dataset.

The number of classes was determined by reading in the provided CSV file using the CSV reader.

* Number of training examples = 34799
* Number of validation examples =  4410
* Number of testing examples = 12630
* Image data shape = (32, 32, 3)
* Number of classes = 43

#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Below is a visualization of the provided data sets. The histograms show the distribution of each class within the three datasets. We can see that the distribution of images is not uniform across all classes, with many classes being under-represented. A sampling of images is show (along with the corresponding grayscaled version of the image).

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

The pre-processing steps for the input images is a simple 3-stage pipeline:

1) Convert image to grayscale using OpenCV.cvtColor() [Returned image is shape (32x32)]
2) Normalize image by subtracting 128 and dividing by 128 for each pixel value.
3) Reshape output image to be shape 32x32x1

For the training set, the dataset has been augmented. For each image in the training set, 3 additional images are generated from the grayscaled image in step 1 of the pre-processing pipeline. The three additional images are generated by taking a random rotation in the range of -30 degrees to -5 degrees and 30 degrees and 5 degrees. The -5 degress to 5 degrees sub-range is removed to reduce the probability that the resulting image is too close to the original image. Along with the rotation, the image is also randomly scaled in the range 75% to 100%.

The rotation was achieved using the OpenCV WarpAffine function along with the getRotationMatrix2D function to create the translation matrix from rotation angle and scale factor. The WarpAffine is done using the BORDER_REPLICATE border mode to remove the black bars at the edges of the scaled and rotated image. I felt these black bars may cause the network to incorrectly train on those edges.

The resulting dataset has 4 images for each image provided in the pickled dataset (grayscale+3 rotated/scaled grayscale images). An example of three images is show below, with the original provided image, and the 4 images that are used as the training set.

#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

The final model I created, TrafficSignNet, was inspired by [GoogLeNet](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~wliu/papers/GoogLeNet.pdf). The main distinguishing feature of GoogLeNet is the use of [inception layers](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-Inception-module-work-in-GoogLeNet-deep-architecture), which I have used in my model. An inception layer consists of 4 parallel layers which operate on the input to the layer, and are concatenated in the depth dimension at the output of the layer:

![alt text][inception_layer]

The inception layer allows the model to not have to choose the best patch size at that particular stage, instead allowing the network to train several possible patch sizes and operations and get the benefit from all of them. The 1x1 convolutions set before the 3x3 and 5x5 convolution branches are used to reduce the dimensionality that is input into the 3x3 and 5x5 convolutions greatly reducing the compute needed for those layers.

One additional interesting characteristic of GoogLeNet, which was also used in TrafficSignNet, is the use of an average pooling layer to "flatten" the final output, rather than reshaping the output from the final convolution stage with a series of fully-connected layers to step down the output shape to the desired number of logits. Only a single fully-connected layer is used for a final reduction to the desired 43 logits. For example, the final convolution layer is 5x5x64 (1600), to reduce this to the desired 43 logits would likely have required several fully connected layers to effectively reduce down. However, an average pooling layer with size (5x5), stride 1 and valid padding returns an output of 1x1x64 (64), which can be reduced to 43 effectively in 1 small fully-connected layer with very good results.

Additionally dropout was added in the average pooling layer.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Type                  | Patch Size/Stride	| Padding | Kernels/Branch |Output Size |
|:---------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------:|:--------------:|:----------:| 
| Convolution           | 5x5/1             | SAME    |                | 32x32x32   |
| Convolution           | 5x5/1             | VALID   |                | 28x28x32   |
| Max Pool              | 2x2/2             | VALID   |                | 14x14x32   |
| Convolution           | 5x5/1             | SAME    |                | 14x14x64   |
| Convolution           | 5x5/1             | VALID   |                | 10x10x64   |
| Inception             |                   |         | 8              | 10x10x32   |
| Inception             |                   |         | 16             | 10x10x64   |
| Max Pool              | 2x2/2             | VALID   |                | 5x5x64     |
| Avg Pool (w/ dropout) | 5x5/1             | VALID   |                | 1x1x64     |
| Fully Connected       |                   |         |                | 43         |


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

The model was trained using the AdamOptimizer reducing the mean of the cross entropy. The training was performed using a single machine with a Core i5 4670 and a GTX 1080 GPU using a batch size of 128, a learning rate of 0.001, and a dropout of 60%. The training was performed over 30 epochs, with the data set being shuffled between each epoch. The model was saved at each epoch if the validation accuracy was equal to or greater than the validation accuracy of all previous epochs. This captures the best trained model accross all epochs. Using this method could have allowed for early stopping when no more improvement of accuracy was seen, but this didn't seem necessary with 30 epochs. Each epoch ran at approximately 60 iterations/s.

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* Training set accuracy of 99.9%
* validation set accuracy of 98.9%
* test set accuracy of 97.5%

Although this did fluctuate some between different training runs.

I took an iterative approach while developing this model. I initially started with the LeNet model from previous labs. First, I adjusted the first layer to accept the 32x32x1 input shape used in the provided dataset, and adjusted the fully connected layers to reduce down to the 43 output classes. The initial results did not meet the 93% accuracy requirement with only these adjustments.

My next step was to increase the depth of the convolutional layers and adding 1x1 convolutions after each convolution layer to then reduce the depth before max pooling. I also added dropout to the fully-connected layers. With these changes the accuracy on the validation set was much better, but the performance on the additional images was very poor.

I then abandoned this model (still present as TrafficSignGrayNet) to develop the final model inspired by GoogLeNet. While taking some inspiration from GoogLeNet, using the full GoogLeNet network would have been overkill, as it is very large. My first attempt was to replace the convolution layers of my first model with the convolution layers followed by inception layers, but keeping the fully-connected layers in place. While this worked well, the training time was longer, and the performance on the additional images suffered a bit with images that were rotated or scaled/transformed. I then replaced the fully-connected layers with the global average pooling with dropout and a small final fully-connected layer. With this model, the results were conistently in the 97-98% range and performed well on the additional images.

At this point, I turned my attention to augmenting the dataset to get slightly better results. I noticed that the model did not always do well with correctly classifying images that were rotated or scaled and translated. So, I augmented the training set with this in mind. This helped to increase the accuracy on images that were transformed in some way, and provided the final accuracy numbers.

Things I tried that didn't have any noticeable effect or made results worse:

1) Adjusting contrast levels in the pre-processing stage

    I noticed that in the training set, many images were dark or had poor contrast, even after converting to grayscale. I tried using histogram equalization on the images using OpenCV, but this caused the performance of the model to degrade

2) Increasing batch size

    I tried various different batch sizes: 128, 256, 512. What I observed was that with larger batch sizes, the training time was slightly lower, but the number of epochs required was much higher, and I could never get results that were as good as the initial batch size of 128. There seemed to be more overfitting with the delta between the training accuracy and validation accuracy being higher than with the smaller 128 image batch size.


### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

I found 12 images from the internet, cropped and resized to make them 32x32 images. I then created two additional images from a single image, one with a brightness reduces and Gaussian noise added and one that was partially occluded:

![alt text][new_images]

I chose some images that I thought might be difficult for the model to classify:

Images 0, 3 and 8 are scaled smaller and have additional auxillary signs underneath them.

Images 3, 5 and 11 are rotated in some way, with image 11 at a particularly extreme angle.

For image 13, I added a black bar across the sign to partially occlude the sign.

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image  | Prediction           |   Actual             |
|:------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
|      0 | General caution      | General caution      |
|      1 | General caution      | General caution      |
|      2 | No entry             | No entry             |
|      3 | Speed limit (30km/h) | Speed limit (30km/h) |
|      4 | Speed limit (30km/h) | Speed limit (30km/h) |
|      5 | Speed limit (70km/h) | Speed limit (70km/h) |
|      6 | Speed limit (70km/h) | Speed limit (70km/h) |
|      7 | Turn right ahead     | Turn right ahead     |
|      8 | Bumpy road           | Bumpy road           |
|      9 | Bumpy road           | Bumpy road           |
|     10 | Bumpy road           | Bumpy road           |
|     11 | Bumpy road           | Bumpy road           |
|     12 | Bumpy road           | Bumpy road           |
|     13 | Bumpy road           | Bumpy road           |

The model was able to correctly classify every image in the set. However, it did have some challenge with images 11 and 13. Prior to adding the augmented training set, image 13 would never classify correctly, and image 11 was mis-classified in roughly 1/2 of the training runs. With the augmented training data, these are now correctly classified in nearly every training run.

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The output for the top-5 softmax probabilities is:

![alt text][new_image_results]

For most of the images, the model is between 99%-100% sure of its choice. However, for the two difficult images, the certainty is lower.

For image 11:

| Guess                        | Certainty |
|:----------------------------:|:---------:|
| Bumpy Road                   | 87.010%   |
| General Caution              | 6.114%    | 
| Slippery Road                | 3.170%    |
| Road Work                    | 1.450%    |
| Wild Animal Crossing         | 1.153%    |

For image 13:

| Guess                        | Certainty |
|:----------------------------:|:---------:|
| Bumpy Road                   | 64.290%   |
| Children Crossing            | 17.785%   | 
| Road Work                    | 2.642%    |
| Bicycles Crossing            | 2.300%    |
| Slippery Road                | 2.064%    |

### (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)
#### 1. Discuss the visual output of your trained network's feature maps. What characteristics did the neural network use to make classifications?

I created visualizations for the convolution layers and inceptions layers using two images of the same sign for comparison.

##### Layer 1

This layer seems to be performaning something that looks like Canny edge detection on the images. The edges within the images are clearly visible here.

![alt text][layer1_vis]
![alt text][layer1_vis_2]

##### Layer 2

This layer appears to be looking more precisely for edges of the sign. This is particularly visible in the second image.

![alt text][layer2_vis]
![alt text][layer2_vis_2]

##### Layer 3

This layer still seems to be activating on particular traits of the image, although it is getting somewhat difficult to distringuish the parts of the image in these cells.

![alt text][layer3_vis]
![alt text][layer3_vis_2]

##### Final Layers
For final layers, it is very difficult to determine what the model is identifying, however, we can see that cells with large activations are similar between the two images. This makes sense, as they are images of the same sign.
