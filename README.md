## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This is my implementation for the Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree Traffic Sign Classifier project. This project uses a neural networks to classify traffic signs. The model is trained and validated using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). Additional images were pulled from the web and classified using this model.


To meet specifications, the project contains three files: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code : [Ipython notebook](https://github.com/cainex/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)
* the code exported as an html file : [Notebook HTML](https://github.com/cainex/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html)
* a writeup report markdown : [writeup](https://github.com/cainex/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup.md) 


### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset and Repository

1. Download the data set. The classroom has a link to the data set in the "Project Instructions" content. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```
